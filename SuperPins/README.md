# SuperPins

This **Zen theme** elevates your experience with pinned tabs and the tab bar in general by making some UI changes, inspired by the favorites in Arc.

## What it does by default:
  - Increases the width of pinned tabs (This can be toggled off)
  - Adds a universal gap between the pinned tabs (Gap size can be controlled)

## Optional Features (toggle in Zen's theme settings):
  - Taller pinned tabs
  - Controllable Margins between pinned tabs (5px or 10px)
  - Box like corners for pinned tabs (less rounded corners)
  - Hide unloaded pinned tabs when tab bar is collapsed (Additional option: Show all pinned tabs on hover even with tab bar collapsed)
  - Color pop for pinned tabs (according to your accent color set in *Settings -> Look and Feel -> Theme Color*)
  - Make pinned tabs transparent
  - Load pinned tabs only when using them, instead of loading all of them on startup
  - Dim unloaded tabs
