# SuperPins

This **Zen theme** elevates your Experience with pinned tabs and the tab bar in general by making some UI changes, inspired by the favorites in Arc.

## What it does by default:
  - Increase the size of pinned tabs
  - Adds a background color (according to your accent color set in *Settings -> Look and Feel -> Theme Color*)
  - Adds some space between the pinned tabs
